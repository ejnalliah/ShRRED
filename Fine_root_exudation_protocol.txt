***Working Protocol Mixture of Rose and colleagues***

Pre-field Prep work: 

-Burn pure sand in muffle furnance to make sure there is no organic material 
-Label plastic syringe for nutrient solution and discarded solution 
-Wash (acid wash?) all materials that will be touched by the extraction (syringes, cuvettes, tubing, luers) 
-Find a container for each material that is transportable and easy to access 
-Label all syringes, cuvettes and sampling bags (eg.T01A)
-Bottle for nutrient solution that is easy to extract with a syringe from 
-container for pure sand that is easy to pour into funnel 
-Print Datasheets


Day 1

1. Base of the tree, remove litter layer and locate a small intact root system (15-20cm). Gently remove roots from soil by brushing away debris and soil with hand. 30 minutes
 
	Materials:
	-Small hand brush 
	-tweezers 

2. Dig a small hole for roots to sit in 

	Materials: 
	-Trowel 

3. Wash roots with a squirt bottle with DI water. Carefully dry roots 

	Materials: 
	-Squirt bottle with DI water 
	-Washing Tray 
	-Paper Towels 

4. place roots in cuvette fitted with mesh funnel at the bottom. 

	Materials: 
	-Glass cuvettes fitted with mesh funnel at bottom 
	-three way stopcock 

5. Fill cuvette with pure sand, covering the roots.  

	Materials:
	-Funnel 
	-pure sand 

6. Using a syringe, put 10 mL of nutrient solution into cuvette and turn the stopcock up (OFF). 

	Materials:
	-plastic syringe dedicated to nutrient solution (Labelled: Nutrient solution) 
	-Nutrient solution 

8. Cover top of cuvette with paraflim, surrounding the root sticking out of the cuvette and cover any protruding root with a moist paper towel 

	Materials: 
	-paper towel 
	-Squirt bottle with DI water 
	-parafilm
	-Scissors 

9. Cover the cuvette with leaves, making sure it is dark (keep in upright position) and cover with aluminum foil. 

	Materials: 
	-Aluminum foil 

10. Let roots in cuvette sit for 24 hours (recovery period).

Day 2

11. After 24 hour recovery period, pull out the solution using a plastic tubing to the stopcock into a plastic syringe. Discard the extract. 

	Materials: 
	-plastic syringe dedicated to pulling out the discarded nutrient solution (Labelled Discard) 
	-plastic tubing 
	-luer connections 

12. Insert 15 mL of nutrient solution, rewrap top of cuvette with parafilm, re-bury with leaves and incubate for 24 hours. 

	Materials:
	-Nutrient Solution 
	-plastic syringe dedicated to nutrient solution input (labeled: Nutrient Solution) 
	-Aluminum Foil 

13. After 24 hour incubation period, pull the 15 mL of solution using a plastic tubing to the stopcock into a labelled plastic syringe. 

	Materials: 
	-Labelled sampling syringe 
	-luer connections 
	-Plastic tubing 

14. Insert 10mL more of nutrient solution into the cuvette and immediately remove it into the labelled plastic syringe (Insuring all exudates are removed from the cuvette. 

	Materials: 
	-nutrient solution 
	-plastic syringe dedicated to nutrient solution input (labeled: Nutrient Solution) 

15. Place the labelled syringes with extract sample on ice in the field. 

	Materials: 
	-Field Ice Chest with Ice 

16. Cut fine-root that had been incubated. Wash off sand with DI water and dry. Place fine-root in moist paper towel and in a labelled sampling bag.

	Materials: 
	-Squirt bottle with DI water
	-Paper towels 
	-Labelled sampling bags 
	-Scissors 

17. Once back in the lab, place fine-roots in fridge and perform Whitman filtration on extracts with 30 micron filter paper 
	
	Materials: IN CHEM LAB

18. Transfer filtered samples to labelled glass scintillation vials 

	Materials: 
	-Scintillation Vials (Labelled) (Eg. T01A MM/DD/YY liquid volume (mL))

19. Place labeled samples in freezer 

20. ASAP: Ship samples back to Mac at VCU 

	Materials: 
	-Shipping container 
	-Dry Ice 


Help from Helen: 

Nutrient Solution: (Need to make at LEAST 1 liter, maybe 1.5 liters) 

0·5 mM NH4NO3, 0·1 mM KH2PO4, 0·2 mM K2SO4, 0·2 mM MgSO4, 0·3 mM CaCl2

Perform a Whitman filtration: 30 microns?



Analysis: 

Pack samples in dry ice and send to Paul B. Lab at VCU for TOC analysis
