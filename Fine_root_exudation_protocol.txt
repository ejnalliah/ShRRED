
Root Exudation Protocol (Adapted from Phillips et al 2008) 

-In-tact fine roots are excavated from soil (15-20 cm) leaving the roots attached. At the interface between O and A horizon and 0.5 meters away from the tree. Roots were traced back to the coarse root or trunk 

-Excavated fine-roots are washed thoroughly to get rid of adhering soil particles. Washed with a squirt bottle containing nutrient solution. (1 hour of washing time). 

-Then, fine-roots are placed in tray with a sand-soil mixture (1:1)(What is this?) for fine-roots to recovery 24-48 hours. 

-Then fine-roots were placed in  30 mL glass cuvette/syringe (Poper & Sons, New Hyde Park, NY) filled with sterile glass beads. Plunger was removed, each syringe was back-filled with sterile acid-washed glass beads (750 micrometer diameter; La De Da Designs, Baton Rouge, LA). 

-At the narrow end of the syringe, a 30 micro m mesh cloth was folded into a cone to support the beads and prevent from clogging the syringe outlet during removal of solution via vacuum pump. 

-A top of syringe, a rubber septum with a small slit cut to accommodate the protruding root was used to seal cuvette. 

-A moist kimwipe was wrapped around exposed portion of root to prevent desiccation

-Small volume of dilute nutrient solution was added to cuvette to maintain humid conditions during incubation

 Cuvettes are then covered with aluminum foil, returned to the excavated area, covered with leaf litter and equilibrated for 2-3 days. Then 2-3 Flushed with nutrient solution to assess exudates. 

-Brotezk et al 2013: 15 ml of C and N free nutrient solution was added to buffer the root system. Roots were incubated for 24 hours. Exudates were then collected by flushing with 15 ml of nutrient solution 3 times. The flushed were stored at -20 C. 

-nonpurgable organic carbon content using an elemental analyzer (Shimadzu-TOC-VCSH). (Rose et al.) Total non-particular organic C on a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) 

-Scaled C exudation by fine root surface area (cm^-2) and mass (g) of each root system. 




Materials: 

-C and N nutrient free solution: What is this? 
-Trays to bury roots (15-25cm long) (Probably can find these in lab) 
-soil: sand mixture 
-Tweezers, other tools to excavate fine-roots (Find in lab) 
-Squirt bottle to wash roots (Find in lab)

Rose’s Protocol: 

-Excavate fine-roots from top horizon (with hands or brushes). 15-20cm: This takes 30-1hour

-Dig a small hole for roots to sit in. 

-Wash roots thoroughly 

-placed wash roots in moist paper towel and rebury for 24 hours 

-Next, place roots in cuvette prepared with mesh funnel at bottom and filled with pure sand or glass beads. Then place fine-roots in cuvette and fill with nutrient solution mixture (record exact amount of solution. 

-incubate for 24 hours. 

-Attach a valve at bottom of cuvette and attach with plastic tubing. On other end attach a second valve and using a syringe, pull liquid out of cuvette. Place liquid in vial with rubber septum. 

-Place vial in cooler, and once back in lab either freeze or refrigerate.

[Currently can do 12 roots per round] 

Alternative, probably more robust protocol: 

Instead of placing wash roots in moist paper towel, have the cuvette set-up ready, place in cuvette with sand and nutrient solution for 24hours. 

-Then, flush out that nutrient solution, add more and leave for 24hours. 

-Extract as above.
