Working Protocol Mixture of Rose's and colleagues: 

1. Base of the tree, remove litter layer and locate a small intact root system (15-20cm). Gently remove roots from soil by brushing away debris and soil with hand. 30 minutes

2. Dig a small hole for roots to sit in 

3. Wash roots with a squirt bottle with DI water. Carefully dry roots 

4. Wrap all exposed roots with a moist paper towel. Rebury for 24 hours (Recovery period) 

5. After 24 hours recovery period, place roots in cuvette fitted with mesh funnel at the bottom. 

6.Fill with cuvette with pure sand, covering the roots. 

7. Using a syringe, put 15 mL of nutrient solution into cuvette and turn the stopcock up (OFF). 

8. Cover top of cuvette with paraflim, surrounding the root sticking out of the cuvette. 

9. Cover the cuvette with leaves, making sure it is dark. (keep in upright position) and incubate for 24 hours. Cover with aluminum foil 

10. After 24 hour incubation period, pull the 15 mL of solution using a plastic tubing to the stopcock into a plastic syringe and then pour the extraction into the TOC vials (labeled!). 

11. Insert 10mL more of nutrient solution into the cuvette remove, and place in TOC vial. (Insuring all exudates are removed from the cuvette. 

12. Place the vials on ice in the field. 

13. Once back in the lab, perform Whitman filtration with 30 micron filter paper 

14. Place labeled samples in freezer 


Alternative protocol for steps 4-5: This step eliminated the first recovery period. Instead of recovering the roots in a moist towel for 24 hours, we are immediately washing, drying and then filtering the roots with a round of nutrient solution and then perform the incubation starting in step 7.  

1. After roots are wash and dried, place in cuvette with mesh funnel at bottom. 

2. Add pure sand until roots are covered. 

3. Add 10 mL of nutrient solution 

4. Paraffin the top of cuvette 

5. Pull out the solution and discard (this is washing the roots). 

6. Continue with step 7 above 



Help from Helen: 

Nutrient Solution: (Need to make at LEAST 1 liter, maybe 1.5 liters) 

0·5 mM NH4NO3, 0·1 mM KH2PO4, 0·2 mM K2SO4, 0·2 mM MgSO4, 0·3 mM CaCl2

Perform a Whitman filtration: 30 microns?
